# An inital software setup for startups

Writing an article about a topic is a great way to organize what you know about it, because you must process the knowledge for your readers. Sometimes complete new ideas come to your mind during the process.
While working on my article ![Everyone needs an email list from day one](@TODO) I started consulting a startup about a software migration.

Since I had started to work as a freelancing software engineer I worked for over 20 companies from different sectors. The first days in a new company are always the same; you set up your development environment on your machine. But although the tasks in the first days are the same, the setup of the development environment is always different. It feels simply over complicated, although the system administrators must have invested tons of hours of work into the setup.

In my opinion a setup should be dead simple and cheap. And I am sure such a setup is possible nowadays with cloud computing and these open source software around.
