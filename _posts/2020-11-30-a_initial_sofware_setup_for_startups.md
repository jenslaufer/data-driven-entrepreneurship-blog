# An inital software/tool stack for bootstrapping startups

## A stack that lets you focus on what matters: your business model

While writing my last article ["Everyone who produces content needs an email list from day one"](@TODO) I was thinking what a good initial software/tool stack for a startup could be.

As Steve Blank once stated is "a startup an organization formed to search for a valuable, repeatable and scalable business model".
Another important principle is "Get out of the building", which means that you are in touch with your customers from the beginning. You don't want to build a product for months or years to realize, that nobody wants it. Instead your goal is to find the business model by [building Minimal Viable Products (MVP)](https://jens-laufer.medium.com/why-is-it-important-to-validate-business-ideas-with-minimal-viable-products-mvp-69e45577c752) in a iterative way. The process is a process of validated learning about the customer's problems with experiments. What could be a software/tool stack for this?

First of all you should not put too much effort on the stack, as your focus is to find your business model (=product-market-fit). Nor should the stack cost too much money to save costs. Using SaaS (Software as a Service) for all the components you need is tempting, however the cost adds up. Many of these services offer free layers, but those layers often lack of important features. Using free open source alternatives are an interesting alternative, although you have to host the solutions by yourself. It's much cheaper than all these SaaS solutions and the administration is nowadays easier than what you think.

**Extra Tipp**

For all SaaS it's better to bring your own domain with, which means that you register the domain with a
domain provider like GoDaddy or Namecheap. You have better control this way, moving services around is easier.

### Blog Software

Following an approach of creating content is a good idea, as the content has different purposes. It helps to build up trust and credibility. It's easier to sell a product to someone that is a fan of your content than to someone that landed on an anomyous landing page.

The content helps to think about your ideas and the customer problems.

One last purpose of a content strategy is that your startup will be found by your prospects on search engines. Search Engine Optimazation (SEO) is the key to a continous flow of vistitors to your website.

To write articles you need a blogging software for it.

## SaaS

| Service                               | Monthly subscription fees |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------: |
| [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) |                    $25.00 |

## Open Source

| Service                                                   |  Fees |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----: |
| [Self hosted Wordpress](https://github.com/mautic/mautic) | $0.00 |

Blogging software solutions are very cheap. Is it really worth your while to save the cost of $25.00 for a hosted Wordpress instead of setting up your own Wordpress and hosting it for $10.00 in the cloud?

Well, it depends: With your own Wordpress you can install every feature you want. On the "machine" the software runs you can install more software than just the Blog Software.

### E-Mail-Marketing Solution

Blog content goes hand in hand with email marketing. You want the readers sign up to your list to stay in touch with them. By staying in touch with your subscribers you might turn some of them into paying customers.

In beginning of your startup journey an email list is important, because you can invite individual users for customer interviews, to prove you hypothesises about your customers and their problems. With the insights from the interviews you build your Minimal Viable Products, that you can show prospects from your list.
