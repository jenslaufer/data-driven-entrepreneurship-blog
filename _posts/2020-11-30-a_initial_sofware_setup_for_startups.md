# An inital software/tool stack for bootstrapping startups

## A stack that lets you focus on what matters: your business model

While writing my last article ["Everyone who produces content needs an email list from day one"](@TODO) I was thinking what a good initial software/tool stack for a startup could be.

As Steve Blank once stated is "a startup an organization formed to search for a valuable, repeatable and scalable business model".
Another important principle is "Get out of the building", which means that you are in touch with your customers from the beginning. You don't want to build a product for months or years to realize, that nobody wants it. Instead your goal is to find the business model by [building Minimal Viable Products (MVP)](https://jens-laufer.medium.com/why-is-it-important-to-validate-business-ideas-with-minimal-viable-products-mvp-69e45577c752) in a iterative way. The process is a process of validated learning about the customer's problems with experiments. What could be a software/tool stack for this?

First of all you should not put too much effort on the stack, as your focus is to find your business model (=product-market-fit). Nor should the stack cost too much money to save costs. Using SaaS (Software as a Service) for all the components you need is tempting, however the cost adds up. Many of these services offer free layers, but those layers often lack of important features. Using free open source alternatives are an interesting alternative, although you have to host the solutions by yourself. It's much cheaper than all these SaaS solutions and the administration is nowadays easier than what you think.

**Extra Tipp**

For all SaaS it's better to bring your own domain with, which means that you register the domain with a
domain provider like GoDaddy or Namecheap. You have better control this way, moving services around is easier.

### Blog Software

Following an approach of creating content is a good idea, as the content has different purposes. It helps to build up trust and credibility. It's easier to sell a product to someone that is a fan of your content than to someone that landed on an anomyous landing page.

The content helps to think about your ideas and the customer problems.

One last purpose of a content strategy is that your startup will be found by your prospects on search engines. Search Engine Optimazation (SEO) is the key to a continous flow of vistitors to your website.

To write articles you need a blogging software for it.
