# An inital software/tool stack for early stage startups

## A stack to let you focus on what matters

While writing my last article ["Everyone who produces content needs an email list from day one"](@TODO) I was thinking what a good initial software/tool stack for a startup could be.

As Steve Blank once stated is "a startup an organization formed to search for a valuable, repeatable and scalable business model".
Another important principle is "Get out of the building", which means that you are in touch with your customers from the beginning. You don't want to build a product for months or years to realize, that nobody wants it. So your goal is to find the business model by [building Minimal Viable Products (MVP)](https://jens-laufer.medium.com/why-is-it-important-to-validate-business-ideas-with-minimal-viable-products-mvp-69e45577c752) in a iterative way. The process is a process of validated learning about the customer's problems with experiments. What could be a software/tool stack for this?

First of all you should not put too much effort on the stack, as your focus is to find your business model (=product-market-fit). Nor should the stack cost too much money to save costs.

One last purpose is that the content is that your startup will be found on the search engines.
