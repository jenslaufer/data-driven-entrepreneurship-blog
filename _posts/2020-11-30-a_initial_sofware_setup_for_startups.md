# An inital Software-/Tool-Stack for Early Stage Startups

## A stack that lets you focus on what matters: The search for your business model

While writing my last article ["Everyone who produces content needs an email list from day one"](@TODO) I was thinking what a good initial software/tool stack for a startup could be.

Steve Blank once stated: "A startup is an organization formed to search for a valuable, repeatable and scalable business model".
Another important principle from him is "Get out of the building", which means that you are in touch with your customers from the beginning. You don't want to build a product for months or years to realize, that nobody wants it. Instead your goal is to find the business model by building [Minimal Viable Products (MVPs)](https://jens-laufer.medium.com/why-is-it-important-to-validate-business-ideas-with-minimal-viable-products-mvp-69e45577c752) in a iterative way, which reduces your financial risk. The process is a sequence of experiments to get validated insights about the customers and their problems. What could be a software/tool stack for this?

First of all should you not put too much effort on the stack, as your focus is to find your business model (=product-market-fit). Nor should the stack cost too much money to keep your costs low. Remember, running out of money means failing. Using SaaS (Software as a Service) for all the components you need is tempting, however the costs add up. Many of these services offer free layers, however those layers often lack of important features. Using free open source software is an interesting alternative, although you have to host the solutions by yourself. The final cost are much lower than for SaaS solutions and the administration is nowadays easier than what you think.

### Content Management System (Must-have)

Following an approach of creating content is a good idea, as the content has different purposes. It helps to build up credibility. It's easier to sell a product to someone who is a fan of your content than to someone that landed on an anomyous landing page through a PPC (Pay per Click) campaign.

Creating content helps to connect your ideas in your mind. You think deeper about your customers and their problems.

One last purpose of a content strategy is that your startup will be found by your prospects on search engines. Search Engine Optimazation (SEO) is the key to a continous flow of free visitors to your website.

To write articles you need a Content Management System (CMS). There are many content management system out there. The most common are Wordpress, Drupal and Typo3. An alternative to a CMS are static website generators like Jekyll, Hugo or Gatsby to name a few. With Jekyll you are able to host your website without any cost on Github.

#### SaaS

| Service                               | Monthly subscription fees |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------: |
| [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) |                    $25.00 |

#### Open Source

| Service                                         |  Fees |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----: |
| [Self hosted Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) | $0.00 |

SaaS CMS solutions are very cheap. Is it really worth your while to save the cost of $25.00 for a hosted Wordpress by setting up your own Wordpress and hosting it for $10.00 in the cloud?

Well, it depends: With a SaaS solution you are stuck with the provider's features. Hosting your own Wordpress offers you the freedom to install every plugin you want. Once you have setup the virtual machine for the CMS you can run other free open source software tools on there.

### E-Mail-Marketing Automation Solution (Must-have)

Content goes hand in hand with email marketing. You want the readers sign up to your list to stay in touch with them. It offers you the chance to turn some of your subscribers into paying customers.

In beginning of your startup journey an email list is important, because you can invite individual subscribers to interviews to prove your hypothesises about your customers and their problems. With the insights from the interviews you are able to build your Minimal Viable Products, which you can show to a limited number of early adopters from your list. By going through the process in multiple iterations you gain insights on your way to the product-market-fit. After finding your final business model you can increase the marketing budget with a lower risk of failing.

An email marketing solution is a software around your email list. The software lets you fragment your subscribers in different lists, move subcscribers between list on actions the subscriber performed like opening mails or clicking links. The software provides a file storage for resources like your lead magnets. Other features are subcscription form and landing page builders. Most solutions offer a kind of point system that add points to subscribers in case of a performed action. This way you can identify your most active and loyal subscribers. These subscribers are the easiest to turn into paying customers.

The variety of features comes as its price: If you want all features I described before, you pay from 50-200 bucks with SaaS providers like [aWeber](https://www.aweber.com/easy-email.htm?id=520754), [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) or [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/) to name a few. Additional costs are the cost for the volume of emails you send out. The costs are quickly adding up to a thousand bucks a month. Maybe not right from the beginning with a small list, as most of these providers offer a free layer with the lack of important features that are essential. However, later when you have a few thousands subscribers these costs may hurt you.

An alternative is to self-host an open-source-marketing email marketing solution like [MailTrain](https://github.com/Mailtrain-org/mailtrain) or [Mautic](https://github.com/mautic/mautic). These solutions provide the most features the SaaS solutions have for $0. The only you must pay for are the costs for the hosting and the fees for the mails you send out. The hosting costs are as low as 10 bucks on [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/938229235b24). With Amazon's Simple Email Service (SES) you pay a fraction of the price sending out the same volume of emails compared to a SaaS provider. It's [literally 34X cheaper](https://medium.com/better-marketing/mailchimp-is-dead-it-just-doesnt-know-it-yet-6e404c3e4b7b).

### Landing Page Builder (Optional)

On your journey as a startup you will build landing pages. Landing pages are standalone pages that are designed for a specific marketing campaign. Landing pages don't have a navigation, the only link they offer is a call-to-action to get the visitor to perform a specific action. The action might be a product purchase, the download of a lead magnet like a white paper, an ebook, a free course or case study. The only purpose of the page is to perform this one action.

Landing pages have an tempting headline to attract prospects. They are benefit-orientated instead of just listing product features; an hero-shot image or video demonstrates the main benefit.

To make live easier SaaS providers offer the functionality of landing page creation. You can choose between a variety of templates with high-conversion rates. The biggest player in the market is [Unbounce](https://unbounce.grsm.io/lander). The Unbounce packages are between $80-$300.

Why is this kind of software optional? Email-marketing-solutions and aContent Management Systems provide as well the possibily to build landing pages, so you rather save the cost.

### Survey Tools (Optional)

To find your scalable, repeatable and valuable business model you must learn about your target customer and his pain points.
Your startup solves these pain points with your products. Surveys are a good way of learning besides interviews.

There are SaaS that let you create surveys without friction.

**Extra Tipp**

For all SaaS solution it's better to bring your own domain with, which means that you register the domain with a domain provider like GoDaddy or Namecheap. You have better control this way, moving services around is easier.
