# A inital software/tool stack for bootstrapping startups

## A stack that lets you focus on what matters: your business model

While writing my last article ["Everyone who produces content needs an email list from day one"](@TODO) I was thinking what a good initial software/tool stack for a startup could be.

As Steve Blank once stated is "a startup an organization formed to search for a valuable, repeatable and scalable business model".
Another important principle is "Get out of the building", which means that you are in touch with your customers from the beginning. You don't want to build a product for months or years to realize, that nobody wants it. Instead your goal is to find the business model by [building Minimal Viable Products (MVP)](https://jens-laufer.medium.com/why-is-it-important-to-validate-business-ideas-with-minimal-viable-products-mvp-69e45577c752) in a iterative way, which reduces your financial risk. The process is a sequence of experiments to learn about the customer and his problems. What could be a laser focused software/tool stack for this?

First of all you should not put too much effort on the stack, as your focus is to find your business model (=product-market-fit). Nor should the stack cost too much money to keep your cost low. Remember, that running out of money means failing. Using SaaS (Software as a Service) for all the components you need is tempting, however the cost adds up. Many of these services offer free layers, however those layers often lack of important features. Using free open source alternatives are an interesting alternative, although you have to host the solutions by yourself. It's much cheaper than SaaS solutions and the administration is nowadays easier than what you think.

**Extra Tipp**

For all SaaS it's better to bring your own domain with, which means that you register the domain with a
domain provider like GoDaddy or Namecheap. You have better control this way, moving services around is easier.

### Blog Software

Following an approach of creating content is a good idea, as the content has different purposes. It helps to build up trust and credibility. It's easier to sell a product to someone that is a fan of your content than to someone that landed on an anomyous landing page.

Creating content helps to structure your ideas. You think deeper about your customer and his problems.

One last purpose of a content strategy is that your startup will be found by your prospects on search engines. Search Engine Optimazation (SEO) is the key to a continous flow of free vistitors to your website.

To write articles you need a blogging software for it.

#### SaaS

| Service                               | Monthly subscription fees |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------: |
| [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) |                    $25.00 |

#### Open Source

| Service                                                   |  Fees |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----: |
| [Self hosted Wordpress](https://github.com/mautic/mautic) | $0.00 |

SaaS Blogging software solutions are very cheap. Is it really worth your while to save the cost of $25.00 for a hosted Wordpress by setting up your own Wordpress and hosting it for $10.00 in the cloud?

Well, it depends: With a SaaS solution you are stuck with the provider's features. Hosting your own Wordpress offers you the freedom to install every feature you want. On the "machine" the software runs on you can install more software than just the Blog Software.

### E-Mail-Marketing Solution

Blog content goes hand in hand with email marketing. You want the readers sign up to your list to stay in touch with them. It offers you the chance to turn some of your subscribers into paying customers.

In beginning of your startup journey an email list is important, because you can invite individual subscribers to customer interviews to prove your hypothesises about your customers and their problems. With the insights from the interviews you are able to build your Minimal Viable Products, which you can show to early adopters from your list. By going through the process in multiple iterations you gain insights on your way to product-market-fit.

An email marketing solution is a software around your email list. The software lets you fragment your subscribers in differnent lists, move subcscribers between list on actions the subscriber performed like opening mails or clicking links. The software offers a file storage for your lead magnet files. Other features are subcscription form and landing page builders. Most solutions offer a kind of point system that add points to subscribers in case of a performed action. This way you can identify your most loyal subscribers. These subscribers are the easiest to turn into paying customers.

This variety of features comes as its price:
