About two years ago, I started writing articles on [my personal blog](https://jenslaufer.com/) about all kinds of topics. The goal was to train my writing muscle because I had realized how important content can be for building up my own business. High-quality content creates credibility, which makes it much easier to sell your products.

At first, my writing was more business-driven and less a matter of the heart than for other writers. However, I learned how great it is. I use it to organize my thoughts and feelings. A lot for my writing is not for the public.

From the beginning, it was clear to me, when I publish a piece, it is less about myself, but rather about enriching the reader with the insights from it. But if you want to use writing for your business, the content has a not-so-selfless purpose: You want your content to be found when a reader searches for information that your article covers to add him to your email list.

For this to happen, your article must contain precisely the information the reader is looking. The reader should be blown away by the knowledge gain. It would be wrong if the reader has the impression that you want to sell him something.

If you have an opt-in to your email list at the end of the article, some readers will sign-up to your email list because you have already build up trust with your valuable piece. The reader "pays" with his personal email address to be informed about future articles or to receive a PDF with further useful knowledge. His email address is the currency in which he pays you for the value of your information. You should also consider the email address as something valuable by not abusing it.

Despite this knowledge, I started my personal blog without an Optin-Form to an email list for various reasons. Existing solutions from providers like Mailchimp, ConvertKit were too expensive for me, or the free version did not have the right features like segmentation or automation workflows. As a software developer, I was thinking to build a solution by myself, which is a stupid idea. However, the main reason I postponed the email list to later was that I did not have confidence in my writing yet and did not expect significant traffic.

But then something surprising happened: I had just published a [new article](https://towardsdatascience.com/example-use-cases-of-docker-in-the-data-science-process-15824137eefd) in my blog and later on Medium. The performance of the post on Medium was disappointing. I checked my Google Analytics account a couple days after publishing to see this:
![Screenshot Google Analytics](/assets/img/screenshot_analyics.png)

The blog was very new, had hardly any visitors and suddenly this flood of visitors? I could not explain it at first. After some research, I found out that my article had been selected for the Google Feed. Obviously, the blog post had covered a topic that many users are interested in. Unfortunately, I had no opt-in form on my website. It would have been an opportunity to add users to my email list who might have become paying customers one day, even though I didn't have a product at that time.

To prevent this from happening to you, I have put together some other reasons why it is crucial to have an email list from day one. I will concentrate on content in written form, but basically what I explain applies to any kind of content.

### As author/blogger: Building a database with subscribers without having a product yet

When you start publishing your articles, you might write about all kinds of topics. You evaluate what you like to write about and what your readers are interested in. Why do you need an email list at this stage?

The email list is, together with Google Analytics, the indicator for your success. You can determine which articles the readers want by the number of subscribers for specific subjects. For this purpose, it is essential to have separate lists for each subject from the beginning. In case you have your first product one day, you can target subscribers from the best-fitting sublist. If you notice that you want to focus on a specific topic, you can start a new blog just for it by moving existing articles to the new blog without even hurting your SEO.

You might object that you can gain a lot of insights from the number of followers, e.g. on Medium. On platforms which you don't own, there is a risk that rules and algorithms can change: If you get blocked, you will lose all followers. With your own email list, everything is in your hands: You can segment your subscribers by topic and send messages to the subscribers in the segment.

In addition to measuring your success, the email list also has the advantage that you can build up a database of potential customers without even having a specific product idea. So you build up a customer base before you even think about product development. You might even have your first product years later.

If you have enough followers, you will be contacted by companies that pay you for advertising or the placement of backlinks.

Also, keep in mind what happened to me: If your article goes viral or is promoted by someone else, you will lose potential customers if you don't have an email right from the beginning.

### As a startup: Create content during product development to build an email list to learn from customers

As a startup, you are looking for a valuable, repeatable and scalable business model. Your goal is to offer a solution (=product) to a customer problem, that exists for a sufficient number of customers (=market). You have to get access to the potential customers (=marketing), and they must be willing to pay as much money for your solution that you can cover your costs to be profitable. You have found your business model when you have achieved this product-market fit.

By performing iterative "experiments", you are heading for the product-market-fit. In these experiments, you build [Minimal Viable Products](https://towardsdatascience.com/example-use-cases-of-docker-in-the-data-science-process-15824137eefd) (MVP), which you show customers as early as possible. Marketing is your focus from the very beginning, it goes hand in hand with your product development.

One strategy is to generate helpful content for potential customers from day one, this way, you can get access to the customers by building up credibility. You can involve these customers early in your product development by showing your Minimal Viable Products to a selected group of subscribers in your email list. In your email list, you look for customers with an early adopter mentality, who are happy to support you in your product development and accept that your product is not perfect yet.

I believe you must write the content yourself because you have the knowledge in your domain. It also helps to organize your ideas and thoughts. On the other hand, external writers are less passionated about your business.

### Full control over your subscriber base

I already mentioned an essential advantage of having your own email list is that you have full control over your subscribers compared to, e.g. the followers of a content platform. You can fragment your subscribers into different buckets, move them around between them based on actions such as opening a particular email. Another advantage of a proper email marketing solution is complex automated email sequences that let you drive your email marketing on autopilot:

By awarding points for specific actions such as opening an email or clicking a link, you can label subscribers with particular characteristics. That way, you might identify, e.g. early adopters for your product.

As mentioned before you need a full email marketing solution for this such as Convertkit, Mailchimp or AWeber. However, if you want features like email automation or segmentation, these tools become quite expensive. A free alternative is Mautic, but you have to host the solution yourself.

### You are prepared if your content goes viral or SEO works

SEO measures need some time before they take effect. There is no exact time when you can check if the efforts have had an impact or not. Therefore it's even more critical that you are prepared for an increasing number of visitors by adding an opt-in to your email list early on.

You might be lucky, and an article goes viral with social marketing. It would be a shame if you missed the chance to fill your email list with many subscribers.

## Summary

If you produce content, you should have an opt-in to your email list from day one. This is important for several reasons:

- You have full control over your subscribers
- You can segment your subscribers
- You can contact subscribers in specific sub-lists.
- You can automate complex email sequences
- By awarding points for specific actions, you can identify subscribers with certain characteristics.
- As a blogger/author, you build a database of subscribers without having any products first. However, your subscribers can become paying customers one day.
- In a startup, you can create a customer database early on with an email list while you are searching for your product-market-fit
- You can contact individual customers to learn from them by showing them [Minimal Viable Products](https://towardsdatascience.com/example-use-cases-of-docker-in-the-data-science-process-15824137eefd).
