You might have noticed that it is more difficult than you thought to find a niche within your [passions](https://insights5.com/business/opportunities/discovery/where_do_i_start_a_business/). A [data-driven approach](/business/opportunities/discovery/the_secret_of_finding_at_idea_for_a_side_hustle/) will help you to find niches, business opportunities or to validate your ideas. However, sometimes there is too much competition in a niche. There are different approaches to solve this problem.

First, you could try to enter the market at lower prices. It's not always the best idea because it reduces your margins. Furthermore, you might start a price war that you can only lose against more established players in the niche.

The trick is to avoid the competition by building a better solution tailored to a subsegment of the market (=sub-niche). Especially interesting are niches that are too small for players already in the market, but big enough for you, because you are perhaps only looking for a side hustle. Of course, you still have to be sure that the sub-niche is big enough for you to generate the income you have set as your goal.

How can you find sub-niches?

I want to take a data-driven approach to tackle the problem as usual. The data I use can be accessed as always on existing platforms on the internet. The method is quite simple: Basically, the point is that there is a search window on many internet platforms. If you enter a search term, the search engine is suggesting additional search terms to you. The proposed terms should support you in your search for a service or a product. They reflect what other customers often look for or show you suitable products or services that are already available in the marketplace. It's what you can use as well when searching for sub-niches.

First, you enter a search term from an area you want to investigate. **The trick is that you now enter your search term, followed by all letters of the alphabet**. Each time you write down the suggested search terms. The whole thing requires some effort, but it is worth it.

The sample screenshots are from [Udemy](https://udemy.com), for the super-niche 'programming". I did the work and extracted [all suggested keywords](programming_subniches.csv) for Fiverr, Amazon, Etsy and Udemy. Here are some search terms that are promising:

| c programming                   | udemy    | 1097569            |

| c++ programming                 | udemy    | 418020             |

There seems to be a need for courses for different programming languages, which is not surprising. However, I did not expect that there would be so many searches for a single programming language. For example, "Java programming" is searched for almost 1.5 million times per month.
The result contains another surprise: On Amazon and Etsy, people look for physical items like mugs, stickers, t-shirts, face masks and decoration for programmers. You could create a website for "Gifts for programmers" or sell articles on Amazon with products you source from China.

But it would help if you further analyzed the found sub-niches as I have described in my article ["The Secret of Finding an Idea for a Side Hustle"](/business/opportunities/discovery/the_secret_of_finding_an_idea_for_a_side_hustle/) to see how big the income possibilities, the competition and the market entry barriers are. Indeed, some of these niches are tiny, but if you are looking for a side hustle, they are not uninteresting.

You can apply this method to all platforms that offer a search window with suggestions. However, you should be aware of the intention of the searcher. People use search engines to search for information. In contrast, a searcher on a platform like Amazon has a clear purchase intention, i.e. he is willing to spend money to solve his problem or satisfy a need. If he finds your product now, you can earn money.

## Conclusion

You can find exciting sub-niches by using the suggestion mechanism in the search window of various Internet platforms, where you can enter all the search suggestions for your search term. The recommendations reflect which services or products are frequently searched for or which products or services already exist.
