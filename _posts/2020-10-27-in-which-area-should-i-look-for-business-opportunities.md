If you follow my articles, you know that I take a data-driven approach to finding business ideas. It's not so much about ideas as it is about business opportunities that you systematically search by using easily accessible data.

However, there is an emotional part of starting your own business that you should not forget: passion. In this article, I would like to explain why it's essential and how you
find your passion.

If you are looking for data-driven business opportunities, you must first have an idea in which area you are starting your search. You might start by researching what is trendy at the moment. Let's take the Corona crisis as an example. The topic of masks is omnipresent because everyone needs one. Why shouldn't you take this opportunity by finding a niche here? I'm sure you would find a lucrative sub-niche with the help of data. What's the problem with that?

Do you just want to sell masks? If you are not enthusiastically sewing masks yourself to sell them on Etsy or create mask designs as a designer, you will not put your heart and soul into it. If the first difficulties arise because you are too inexperienced as a founder, you will give up quite quickly. It's the case with many founders. For sure, money can replace the lack of passion as a motivator, but not in the long run.

A few years ago, I experienced this first hand when I discovered the niche "aphtha treatment" with the help of keyword analysis. I often had problems with them and found out that I could fight them quite effectively with pure ascorbic acid (=Vitamin C). So I wanted to sell ascorbic acid in small pack sizes as a kind of fight-apathetic-formula. Quickly I had created a landing page with a matching pay-per-click campaign on Google. With the help of the test campaign, I was able to validate that the niche had potential. However, during my research, I encountered a difficulty: The sale of medical products is strictly regulated in Germany so that I couldn't sell my product without permission. A problem that can be solved if you get these permits. Do you know what happened? I buried the idea because I didn't feel much like this kind of product anyway.

**The secret is to start a business in areas where you are a professional, and you love. Nothing and nobody can stop you then. You have to find your passion. I define passion as the intersection of what you are good at and what you love.

For starting your own business, business opportunities are another component: You search for these opportunities using data from the Internet according to your passions. In the beginning, you may only have a side hustle to generate additional income, which you can expand into your own business over time.

I want to show you how to find your passions:

### What you are good at

What are you good at? All your skills from your professional or private life are part of it. Besides the practical skills, don't forget to include the areas in which you have a broad knowledge. Write everything down without evaluating whether you can earn money with it. Everything belongs in the list even if it seems weird. Sometimes the weird offers enormous opportunities.

Here is an example of how such a list could look like:

- Excel
- Kitesurfing
- Football
- Gossip
- Empathy
- Foreign countries
- Teaching
- Spanish

### What you love

What do you love? These are the activities you would do all day long in case money wouldn't an issue for you. You rest in yourself when you do these things.

Examples:

- Kitesurfing
- Billiards
- Travel
- Read
- Letter

### The sweet spot of passion

In the example, we saw that 'Kitesurfing' appeared in both lists. Congratulations you have found something you should focus on when looking for business opportunities.

But it is not always that easy. Sometimes we have hobbies that we pursue with passion without being good at them. However, that doesn't matter as they are fun, and that is important. On the other hand, we are good at something at work that we don't like at all.

In this case, try to find skills that can be combined well with other activities. Your ability to teach lets you offer online courses on what you love. Or you could combine your love for writing with your knowledge of football by starting a blog.

Now try to define keywords. You will need them to search the Internet for business opportunities:

- Kitesurfing
- Kitesurfing
- Kitesurfing Course
- Kitesurfing Excel
- Kitesurfing Travel
- Football Blog

### Business Opportunities

The last component is business opportunities. You search for them analytically with data you find on the Internet. To do this, you search through various Internet marketplaces, with the keywords you wrote down before. The internet marketplaces offer their customers different metrics, which you use for your advantage.

In my article ["The Secret of finding an idea for a side hustle"](https://insights5.com/business/opportunities/discovery/the_secret_of_finding_an_idea_for_a_side_hustle/) I have described this in more detail.

## Conclusion

You should try to start a business on what you know and love, or in other words, on something you have a passion for. It's crucial to stay on track in difficult times. You can find your passions by looking for the intersection of what you love, and you are good at. In this intersection, you systematically search for business opportunities with the help of data.
