If you follow my articles you know that I take a data-driven approach to finding business ideas. This is not so much about ideas as it is about business opportunities that you systematically search for using easily accessible data.

However, there is an emotional part of starting your own business that you should not forget: passion. In this article I would like to explain why it is important and how you
find your passion.

If you are looking for data-driven business opportunities, you must first always be clear in which area you are starting your search. Surely you can start by researching what is trendy at the moment. Let's take the Corona crisis as an example. The topic of masks is omnipresent because everyone needs one. Why shouldn't you jump on the bandwagon by finding a niche in masks? I'm sure you would find a lucrative sub niche with the help of data. What's the problem with that?

Do you really just want to sell masks? If you are not enthusiastically sewing masks yourself to sell them on Etsy or creating your own designs as a designer, you will not really put your heart and soul into it. If the first difficulties arise because you are too inexperienced as a founder, you will give up quite quickly. This is the case with many founders. Certainly money can replace the lack of passion as a motivator, but not in the long run.

A few years ago I experienced this first hand when I discovered the niche "aphtha treatment" with the help of a keyword analysis. I myself often had problems with them and found out that I could fight them quite effectively with pure ascorbic acid (=Vitamin C). So I wanted to sell ascorbic acid in small pack sizes as a kind of aphtaethic way formula. Quickly I had created a landing page with a matching pay-per-click campaign on Google. With the help of the test campaign I was able to validate quite quickly that the niche had potential. However, during my research I encountered a difficulty: The sale of medical products is strictly regulated in Germany, i.e. I could not sell my product so easily without permission. A problem that can be solved if you get these permits. Do you know what happened? I buried the idea because I didn't feel much like this kind of product anyway.

**The secret is to start a business in areas where you are a professional and you love. Nothing and nobody can stop you then. You have to find your passion. I define passion as the intersection of what you do well and what you love.

For starting your own business, business opportunities are another component. You search for these opportunities using data from the Internet according to your passions. In the beginning you may only have a sideline job to generate additional income, which you can expand into your own business over time.

In the following I would like to show you how to find your passions:

### What you do well

What are you good at? All your skills from your professional or private life are part of it. Besides the practical skills, don't forget to include the areas in which you have a broad knowledge. Write everything down without evaluating whether you can earn money with it. Everything belongs in the list even if it is extraordinary. Sometimes the extraordinary offers huge opportunities.

Here is an example of how such a list could look like:

- Excel
- Kitesurfing
- Soccer
- Gossip and gossip
- Empathy
- Foreign countries
- Teachings
- Spanish

### What you love

What do you love? These are the activities you would do all day long if money was not an issue for you. You rest in yourself when you do these things.

Examples:

- Kitesurfing
- Billiards
- Travel
- Read
- Letter

### The sweet spot of passion

In the example we saw that 'Kitesurfing' appeared in both lists. Congratulations you have found something you should focus on when looking for business opportunities.

But it is not always that easy. Sometimes we have hobbies that we pursue with passion without being good at them. What is the point? They are fun and that is important. On the other hand, we are good at something at work that we don't like at all.

In this case, try to find skills that can be combined well with other activities. In our example, the ability Excel stands out. Many other points can be combined with it, because many customers search Excel sheets in all possible areas. Your ability to teach others can also be combined with many things you love. This way you could offer online courses in an area you love. Or you could combine your passion for writing with your knowledge of football by starting a blog.

Now try to define terms. You will need them to search the internet for business opportunities:

- Kitesurfing
- Kitesurfing
- Kitesurfing Course
- Kitesurfing Excel
- Kitesurfing Travel
- Football Blog

### Business Opportunities

The last component to come into play is business opportunities. You search for them analytically with data you find on the Internet. To do this, you search through various Internet marketplaces. These offer their customers different metrics, which you use for your purposes.
In my article ["The Secret of finding an idea for a side hustle"](https://insights5.com/business/opportunities/discovery/the_secret_of_finding_an_idea_for_a_side_hustle/) I have described this in more detail.

## Conclusion

You should try to start a business in an area you know and love, or in other words, in an area you have a passion for. This is important in order to stay on track in difficult times. You can find your passions by looking for the intersection of the areas you love and the areas you are good at. In this intersection you systematically search for business opportunities with the help of data.
