# Everyone who produces content needs an email list from day one

## Why it is important whether as a startup or as an author and how I learned the lesson

About two years ago I started writing articles on [my personal blog](https://jenslaufer.com/) about all kinds of topics. The goal was to train my writing muscle, because I had realized how important content can be for building up my own business. High quality content creates trust, which makes it much easier to sell your own products.

At first, writing was more business driven for me and less a matter of heart than for other writers. However, I love it now, I also use it to organize my thoughts and feelings. Much of it I do not publish at all.

From the beginning it was clear to me, when I publish an article, it is less about myself, but rather about enriching the reader with the insights from the article. But if you want to use writing for your business, the content has a not-so-selfless purpose: You want your content to be found when a reader searches for information that your article covers to add him to your email list.

For this to happen, your article must contain exactly the information the reader is looking for. You deliver a piece of writing that entertains. The reader should be blown away by the knowledge gain. It would be bad if the reader has the impression that you want to sell him some low-quality products.

If you have an opt-in to your e-mail list at the end of the article, some readers will sign-up to your E-Maillist because you have already build up trust with your valuable article. The reader "pays" with his personal e-mail address to be informed about future articles or to receive a PDF with more valuable information. His e-mail address is the currency in which he pays you for the value of your information. You should also consider the address as something valuable by not abusing it.

Despite this knowledge I started my personal blog without an Optin-Form to an E-Maillist in for various reasons. Existing solutions from providers like Mailchimp, ConvertKit were too expensive for me or the free version did not have the right features like segmentation or automation workflows. As a software developer I was thinking to build a solution by myself, which is a stupid idea. However, the main reason I postponed the E-Maillist to later was that I did not have confidence in my writing yet and did not expect significant traffic.

But then something surprising happened: I had just published a [new article](https://towardsdatascience.com/example-use-cases-of-docker-in-the-data-science-process-15824137eefd) in my blog and later on Medium. The performance of the article on Medium was disappointing. I checked my Google Analytics account a few days later to see this:

![Screenshot Google Analytics](assets/screenshot_analyics.png)

The blog was very new, had hardly any visitors and suddenly this flood of visitors? I could not explain it at first. After some research I found out that my article had been selected for the Google Feed which had attracted many readers. Obviously the article had covered a topic that many users are interested in. Unfortunately I had no optin form on my website. It would have been a opportunity to add users to my email list who might have become paying customers one day, even though I didn't have a product at that time.

To prevent this from happening to you, I have put together some other reasons why it is important to have an email list from day one. I will concentrate on content in written form, but basically what I explain applies to any kind of content.

### As author/blogger: Building a database with subscribers without having a product yet

When you start publishing your articles, you might write about all kinds of topics. You try out what you like to write about and what your readers are interested in. Why do you need an email list at this stage?

The email list is, next to Google Analytics, the indicator for the success of your efforts. You can determine which articles the readers want by the number of subscribers for topics. For this purpose it is important to have seperate lists for each topic from the beginning. Then you can later reach parts of your readership if you have a first product. If you notice that you want to focus on a specific topic, you can start a new blog just for it. You can also move existing articles to the new blog if you pay attention to a few things.

You might object that you can gain a lot of insights from the number of followers, e.g. on Medium. On platforms you have to expect that rules and algorithms will change: If you get blocked, you will lose all followers. With your own e-mail list you have full control: You can segment your subscribers by topic, for example, and address them specifically.

In addition to measuring your success, the e-mail list also has the advantage that you can build up a database of potential customers without even having a concrete product idea. So you build up a customer base before you even think about product development. Your might even have your first product years later.

If you have enough followers, you will be contacted by companies that pay you for advertising or the placement of backlinks.

Also keep in mind what happened to me: If your article goes viral or is promoted by someone else, you will lose potential customers.

### As a startup: Create content during product development to build an E-Maillist to learn from customers

As a start-up, you are looking for a valuable, repeatable and scalable business model. Your goal is to offer a solution (=product) to a customer problem, which has a sufficient number of customers (=market) to which you have to find an access (=marketing). Customers must be willing to pay as much money for your solution to cover your costs to be profitable. You have found your business model when you have achieved this product-market fit.

You the Product-Market-Fit in the form of iterative "experiments". In these experiments you build [Minimal Viable Products](https://towardsdatascience.com/example-use-cases-of-docker-in-the-data-science-process-15824137eefd) (MVP), which you show customers as early as possible. Marketing is your focus from the very beginning, along with product development.

One strategy is to generate helpful content for potential customers from day one, because you will find access to the customers by building a basis of trust. You can involve these customers early in your product development by showing your Minimal Viable Products to a selected group of subscribers in your E-Maillist. You look for customers with an early adopter mentality, who are happy to support you in your product development and accept that your product is not perfect yet. You will find these customers in your email list, so it is important to build them from day 1.

I think it is very important that you write the content yourself, because you have the knowledge in your domain. It also helps to organize your ideas and thoughts. External writers are less passionated about your business.

### Full control over your customer

I already mentioned, an important advantage of having your own e-mail list is that you have full control over your subscribers compared to the followers of a content platform, for example. You can fragment your subscribers into different lists, move them between different email lists based on actions such as opening a particular email. You can also map complex automated email sequences:

![Mautic email automation workflow](https://www.digitale-wunderwelt.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mautic-campaign-builder-1024x889.png)

You can identify particularly akive customers via a point system that awards points for certain actions such as opening an e-mail or clicking a link. If you do it cleverly, you could even identify customers with a certain characteristic, e.g. early adopter mentality, this way.

But for this you need an email marketing solution such as Convertkit, Mailchimp. But if you want features like email automation or segmentation, these tools become quite expensive. A free alternative is Mautic, but you have to host the solution yourself.

### You are prepared if your content goes viral or SEO works

SEO measures need some time before they take effect. Especially there is no exact time when you can check if the measures have had an effect or not. Therefore it is even more important that you are prepared by adding an opt-in to your email list early if the number of visitors increases.

With social marketing you can be lucky and your content will go viral. It would be a shame if you missed the chance to fill your email list with many subscribers.

## Summary

If you produce content, you should have an opt-in to your email list from day one. This is important for several reasons:

- You have full control over your subscribers
  - You can assign subscribers to different segments
  - You can contact subscribers in specific segments.
  - You can automate complex e-mail sequences
- As a blogger/author, you build a database of subscribers without having any products first. However, your subscribers can become paying customers if you have a product at some point
- In a startup, you build a customer database early on while you search for your final business model.
  - You can contact a small number of subscribers to learn from them by showing them [Minimal Viable Products](https://towardsdatascience.com/example-use-cases-of-docker-in-the-data-science-process-15824137eefd).
