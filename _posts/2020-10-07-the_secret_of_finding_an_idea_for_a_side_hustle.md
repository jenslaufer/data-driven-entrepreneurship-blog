The moment of enlightenment came when I was looking for a gig on Fiverr for Logos. I searched the service providers with the aim of finding the most suitable one for me. However, the search overtaxed me with increasing duration, because there were simply too many providers. To be more systematic, I quickly wrote a small program (scraper) to extract data such as average rating, number of ratings, price of the different providers into a database. Now it was much easier to find the right provider, because I could analyze the data more precisely. Within a very short time I had found the provider I still work with today.

In my following coffee break I thought again about what I had just done. Suddenly I had this flash of inspiration. With the data that websites provide to their customers to help them in their product search I was able to do something else: I can systematically use the data to search the Internet marketplaces for business opportunities or to evaluate my business ideas.

I realized something else. For years I had concentrated on innovative business ideas. These had originated from my creativity. Many ideas had usually disappeared into thin air because there was simply no market for them. Surely you can succeed in bringing a completely new, innovative product to the market. The iPhone as an example will come to your mind immediately. But are we Apple with all its experience and its huge marketing budget? No, we are Mrs. or Mr. Unknown, struggling to make their first money. We should focus on the simplest strategies, the "Low Hanging Fruits". Instead of finding creative business ideas, we should systematically use data to find opportunities for business. Instead of being innovative, we should concentrate on what already works.

**The secret to identifying these business opportunities is the data that Internet marketplaces make available to their customers free of charge.

After my break I investigated which metrics from different Internet marketplaces for different product types:

- **Amazon**

- **Fiverr**

- **Udemy**

- **Gumroad**

All these marketplaces offer similar metrics to support the customer in the buying process, which we can use for our purposes.

### Example

When building your own business or part-time job, it is about finding
a profitable niche. The niche must be large enough to generate enough revenue for you and
small enough to keep larger players out. **The key to own business is a low
Market entry barrier, little competition and high revenue potential in a niche**. This "formula" can be applied to any marketplace. In this example, we will apply it specifically to Fiverr by focusing on three niches that we believe you have the ability to offer services to:

Logo design
WordPress
Copywriting

As metrics that describe the potential of a niche we define

Competition
Revenue potential
Market Entry Barrier

But how can we calculate them?

On the Fiverr site we find the numbers we need for a keyword(=niche) and from which we can calculate new metrics.

You can find the number of gigs in the upper right corner. For each gig you will see the price, the number of reviews and the average rating. You will also get the sales level of the supplier. A seller gets a higher sales level when he reaches a certain number of sales with a high number of positive ratings.

You have to enter the information for all gigs on the first page one in a table to get an overall picture.

Let's dive into the analysis. I have visualized the results in order to make them better understandable:

![Fiverr niche analysis for logo design, wordpress, copywriting](/assets/img/all_plot.png)

#### demand

To get an idea of the demand in the different niches we calculate the total number of reviews of all the gigs on the first page. With this sum we can estimate the demand in a niche.

The demand for 'Logo Design' is by far the highest of these three niches. The demand for copywriting is slightly lower than for the other two niches.

#### Supply

We want to secure a share of the market, so we have to look at the offer. We evaluate thereby the competition in the niche and/or market. We can draw conclusions about the offer by the total number of all gigs.

It is interesting that there are many gigs for 'Wordpress' and 'Logo Design'. These niches seem to be very crowded. But that doesn't have to be bad if there is still room for new providers. It's surprising how few gigs there are for copywriting. However, we have also seen before that there is less demand for this niche.

The demand for copywriting is lower than for the other niche but not in the same proportion as the supply of gigs.

#### Competition

We want to take a closer look at what we just found out from the perspective of the competition in the niches.

To get an idea of the competition, we can aggregate a new metric. We
have estimated the offer over the total number of gigs. On the other hand, the total number of ratings reflects the demand. The relationship between the two metrics can be interpreted as a measure of competition.

We see that 'WordPress' is the niche with the most competition, followed by 'Logo
Design'. The niche 'copywriting' has much less competition, which would be a chance for you.

#### Market entry barrier

If you want to secure a market share in a niche, you have to keep in mind how difficult it is to enter the market. Fiverr pushes gigs with positive reviews by placing them at the top of the first page. It wants to protect these sellers so that they don't leave the platform.

On the other hand, gigs of new sellers are placed on the first page from time to time to give them a chance to establish themselves in the market, because otherwise they will leave the platform again. This is the balancing act that every market platform has to perform.

You can see that for copywriting, there are many more sellers on the first page who have not yet reached a sales level than for the other two niches. This is an indication that there is still room for new vendors in this niche.

#### Revenue potential

As a last important criterion we want to consider the revenue potential of a niche. We multiply the entry price of the gigs by the number of reviews, because this is an indication of the revenue potential. The number is inaccurate because we don't know the percentage of buyers who rate their purchase, but it is still an indication to compare the revenue potential of niches.

The revenue potential for copywriting is lower than for the other two niches. This is a negative point for the niche. However, you might be able to fill a sub niche with higher prices.

## Conclusion

Using metrics that many market platforms provide to customers to make their shopping easier, you can find opportunities for ports or evaluate your ideas.

In an example we have compared three niches on Fiverr: We found that there is a demand for copywriting with little competition from other providers.
