When I was looking for a gig on Fiverr for logo design, I experienced a moment of enlightenment. I searched the sellers to find the most suitable one for me. However, the search overwhelmed me with increasing duration, because there were simply too many providers. To be more systematic, I quickly wrote a small program (scraper) to extract data such as average rating, number of ratings, price of the different providers into a database. Now it was much easier to find the right seller because I could analyze the data more precisely. Within a short time, I had found the seller I still work with today.

In my coffee break afterwards, I thought again about what I had just done. Suddenly I had this new idea. With the data that websites provide to their customers to assist them in their product search, I could do something else: I could systematically use the data to search these Internet marketplaces for business opportunities or to evaluate my business ideas.

I realized something else. For years I had concentrated on innovative business ideas. They had originated from my creativity. Many ideas were at the end not so brilliant as there was simply no market for them. Surely you can succeed in bringing a completely new, innovative product to the market. The iPhone is a great example that might come to your mind. But are we Apple with all its experience and its vast marketing budget? No, we are Mrs. or Mr Unknown, struggling to make their first money. We should focus on the most straightforward strategies, the "Low Hanging Fruits". Instead of finding creative business ideas, we should systematically use data to find business opportunities. Instead of being innovative, we should concentrate on what already works.

**The secret to identifying business opportunities in the data that Internet marketplaces offer their customers for free.**

After my break, I investigated the metrics that different Internet marketplaces offer their clients to assist their product search:

- **Amazon**

- **Fiverr**

- **Udemy**

- **Gumroad**

Indeed all these marketplaces offer similar metrics to support the customer in the buying process, which we can use for our purposes.

### Example

When building your own business or side hustle, it's all about finding
a profitable niche. The niche must be large enough to generate enough revenue for you and
small enough to keep larger players out. **The key to own business is a low
market entry barrier, little competition and high revenue potential in a niche**. This "formula" can be applied to any marketplace. Let's assume you are an expert in all these niches:

Logo design
WordPress
Copywriting

As metrics that describe the potential of a niche we define

Competition
Revenue potential
Market Entry Barrier

But how can we calculate these metrics?

On the Fiverr site, we find the numbers we need for a keyword(=niche) and from which we can calculate new metrics.

You can find the number of gigs in the upper right corner. For each gig you will see the price, the number of reviews and the average rating. You will also get the sales level of the supplier. A seller receives a higher sales level when he reaches a certain number of sales with a significant number of positive ratings.

You have to enter the data for all gigs from page one to a worksheet to get an overall picture.

Let's dive into the analysis. I have visualized the results to make them better understandable:

![Fiverr niche analysis for logo design, WordPress, copywriting](/assets/img/all_plot.png)

#### Demand

To get an idea of the demand in the different niches, we calculate the total number of reviews of all the gigs on the first page. With this sum, we can estimate the demand in a niche.

The demand for 'Logo Design' is by far the highest of these three niches. The need for copywriting is slightly lower than for the other two niches.

#### Supply

We want to acquire a share of the market, so we have to look at the supply. We can draw conclusions about the supply by the total number of all gigs.

Interestingly, there are many gigs for 'WordPress' and 'Logo Design'. These niches seem to be very crowded. But that doesn't have to be bad if there is still room for new providers. It's surprising how few gigs there are for '     'Copywriting'. However, we have also seen before that there is less demand for this niche.

The demand for 'Copywriting' is lower than for the other niche but not in the same proportion as the supply of gigs.

#### Competition

We want to take a closer look at what we just found out from the perspective of the competition in the niches.

To get an idea of the competition, we can aggregate a new metric. We
have estimated the supply by the total number of gigs. On the other hand, the total number of ratings reflects demand. The relationship between the two metrics can be interpreted as a measure of competition.

We see that 'WordPress' is the niche with the most competition, followed by 'Logo Design'. The niche 'Copywriting' has much less competition, which would be a chance for you.

#### Market entry barrier

If you want to secure a market share in a niche, you have to keep in mind how difficult it is to enter the market. Fiverr pushes gigs with positive reviews by placing them at the top of the first page. They want to protect these sellers so that they don't leave the platform.

On the other hand, gigs of new sellers are placed on the first page from time to time to give them a chance to establish themselves in the market, because otherwise, they will leave the platform immediately. This is the balancing act that every market platform has to achieve.

You can see that for 'Copywriting', there are many more sellers on the first page who have not yet reached a sales level than for the other two niches. This is an indication that there is still room for new vendors in this niche.

#### Revenue potential

As a last important criterion, we want to consider the revenue potential of a niche. We multiply the entry price of the gigs by the number of reviews because this is an indication of the revenue potential. The number is inaccurate because we don't know the percentage of buyers who rate their purchase, but it can be used to compare the revenue potential of niches.

The revenue potential for 'Copywriting' is lower than for the other two niches. This is a negative point for the niche. However, you might be able to fill a sub-niche with higher prices.

## Conclusion

Using metrics that many market platforms provide to their customers to help them with their shopping decisions, you can find business opportunities or evaluate your ideas.

In this example, we compared three niches on Fiverr: We found there is an opportunity for copywriting gigs.
